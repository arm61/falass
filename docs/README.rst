falass
======

falass is a pure python library for the calculation of neutron and X-ray relectometry data from molecular simulation. 

This was originally developed during a co-funded PhD studentship split between the University of Bath and Diamond Light Source.

An example Jupyter notebook showing the usage of falass is available from the GitHub source: https://github.com/arm61/falass

If you have any question or idea for development please get in touch: arm61@bath.ac.uk
